## Iowa Ability-to-Pay Calculator

Under Iowa law, some people are assessed "court debt" – i.e. debt people owe due to their involvement in a criminal, civil, or juvenile case. This can include fines and victim restitution, but also a range of fees for the services of a court, a jail, or appointed defense counsel. Much of these fees in the latter category of debt are only supposed to be charged if the person has the "ability to pay."

Even though the law requires an ability to pay assessment, it doesn't provide much guidance on what that means. This calculator attempts to make the issue more concrete by borrowing a long-standing model from the Internal Revenue Service – the collection financial standards. This standards are based on periodically updated data from a number of federal agencies about costs of housing, food, medicine, transportation, and other important costs. This data gives a picture of the realistic costs of maintaining basic household necessities without requiring a defendant, their lawyer, or the court to go through a mountain of documentation.
